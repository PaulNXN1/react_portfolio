# react_portfolio üèóÔ∏è
Module 20 assignment was to create a portfolio using **REACT**.  Students were not given pre-written code and had to submit a deployed application meeting


## Description:

The assignment was to have liberty of creating a portfolio page using react.js.
For the portfolio assignment, I used react and tailwind css in order to create a dynamic UI that is mobile responsive.  
All criteria were met, but in a special way. 

For example:
- The third party platforms and icons were placed on the left side of the page, resulting in an animation when the user hovers over each piece for GitHub, LinkedIn, Email, and Resume.  This was done for advanced practicing and to show hard work in creativity.  This menu will stay with the user as they scroll up and down on the page.  

- Secondly, a package called **react-scrolls** was utilized in order for the user to have a *smooth* transition and animations to each section of the portfolio, rather than having to load a page.  This method is more fluid and easier on the eye!  


## User Story:
Module 20's Pre-Written User Story by UPENN:

"AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications

SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position"
